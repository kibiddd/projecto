CUSTOMER REVIEWS





















Well-dressed professional and knowledgeable performed the inside and outside spray with a minimum of fuss and di d a sensational job as well.
6 months have passed and still no pests. I have already recommended Pulse Pest Management to my friends and family.





AmandaSydney, Australia






The pulse technician was very punctual and put our mind at rest as we have young children and were worried about the chemicals, he explained they were complexly safe. He did a fantastic job as well. I highly recommend anyone to use this business for your next pest control!
