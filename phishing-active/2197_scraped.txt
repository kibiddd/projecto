Early on, I knew that I wanted to pursue some sort of career involving computers. I can not quite pin down what sparked that interest, but I have been passionate about learning as much as I can about computers and electronics as I possibly can. This has led me to become familiar with an array of programming languages and computer platforms. I continue to learn more about computers through personal programming projects and about electronics through hobbyist electronic projects.









My Resume



Education

Master of Science in Computer Engineering
2020 - 2021
Mercer University, Macon, GA
While working towards the completion of my masters, I focused on Software Engineering and Database Design.


Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
2016 - 2020
Mercer University, Macon, GA
My undergraduate studies primarily focused on embedded systems, object-oriented programming, and operating system theory.

Projects

High Altitude Research Platform Project Lead
2017 - 2019
Mercer University, Macon, GA
I led a team to prepare and launch a redesigned stratospheric research capsule to collect temperature data and live stream video footage of the Great American Solar Eclipse. During this project, I ensured that software and hardware of on-payload and off-payload components are properly programmed and ready for weather balloon launches. The current effort before I left was to redesign the research capsule and ground station to allow local schools to perform cheap, high altitude, low pressure experiments.

Hobbies

Homelabbing
I run enterprise-grade servers and networking equipment at home as a way to grow my knowledge in hypervisors, Linux servers, Windows servers, load balancers, and Cisco switches.


Programming
When I face a problem that can be solved with programming, I love to use it as a chance to explore new languages, APIs, and libraries. Some projects of this variety include a Map Keeping program for a D&D game and a Music Bot for Discord.


Electronics
I like to create projects using electical components like microcontrollers, servos, sensors, buttons, etc. My favorite electronic project was a DIY access control system using a servo, Raspberry PI, and an SQL Server to scan a student ID and provision access based on the information from the scanned card.


Dungeons and Dragons
I have played Dungeons and Dragons as both a player and DM in multiple campaigns that have spanned multiple years. In addition to being a fun and cooperative storytelling game, it also encourages creative problem solving, team building, and planning skills.
