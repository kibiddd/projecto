Hi, I’m Dan.
I'm a former PE investor... turned PE operator... turned PE advisor.
In 2021, I spun out of an in-house PE role so I could help more firms and their portfolio companies, and do work I love on my own terms.
Today, I write for, consult with, and create things for PE groups and their portfolio companies. My mission: to help PE-backed companies accelerate people-powered value creation.













READ THINGS I'VE WRITTEN:
Advice I wish I had when I joined my first PE Board
Ten traps for first-time PE CEOs and how to avoid them
A PE professional's blueprint for winning the first 100 days
