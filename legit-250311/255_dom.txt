  "answer1": "The domain was created on 1999-02-15 and the registration was last updated on 2025-01-14. This means the domain has been registered for over 26 years, which is not recent. The expiration date is 2026-02-15, which is more than a year away. Therefore, the domain is not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The registrar's contact information is provided, including an abuse contact email and phone number. There is no indication that the contact information is redacted, partial, or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, DomainSite, Inc., is listed as a WHOIS server, but there is no information provided about whether it is known for hosting malicious sites or lacks verification. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine if this is a red flag.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common restriction for domains managed by registrars or hosting providers. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag, as many domains do not use DNSSEC. The domain name itself, 'essaydepot.com', does not immediately suggest any suspicious activity. However, the URL provided (https://www.essaydepot.com/documents/locality-of-amravati/1) is not directly related to the domain in question and does not provide additional information about potential fraud indicators.",
