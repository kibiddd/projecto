  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2019-04-27 and the registration is expiring on 2025-04-27, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not recent nor expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (Abuse Contact Email: abuse@support.gandi.net and Phone: +33.170377661) is not redacted or partial; it appears to be legitimate.",
  "answer3": "Gandi SAS is a well-known registrar, and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. The registrar is reputable and widely used.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This is a common restriction and not necessarily a fraud indicator. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not uncommon and does not necessarily indicate fraud. The domain is hosted on Linode's name servers, which is a legitimate hosting provider.",
