  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2007-06-26 and is expiring in 2025-06-26, which is more than 6 months ago. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of being recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@godaddy.com and phone number 480-624-2505) is not redacted, partial, or suspicious. It is a valid contact method for reporting abuse.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that GoDaddy hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client actions such as deletion, renewal, transfer, and update are prohibited. This could be a red flag, but it is not necessarily indicative of fraud without further context. The domain is also using unsigned DNSSEC, which is not ideal but not necessarily fraudulent.",
