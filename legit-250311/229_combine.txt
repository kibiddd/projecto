  "Summary": "The website 'the-movie-times.com' appears to be a legitimate movie-related website with a standard URL structure and a common TLD. The domain was created in 1998 and is expiring soon, but the registrar is reputable. The WHOIS information is complete and the domain status indicates client transfers are prohibited. The screenshot analysis shows a technical error related to the SSL handshake, but there are no signs of phishing, suspicious offers, impersonation, or other fraudulent activities. The website's functionality seems disrupted, but not designed to steal personal information directly. The error message suggests a technical issue with the SSL handshake, but it doesn't mean that the website is fraudulent itself.",
