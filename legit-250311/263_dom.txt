  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2004-04-25 and is expiring on 2025-04-25, which is more than 6 months away. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of being recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@godaddy.com and phone number 480-624-2505) is not redacted or partial; it is complete and appears legitimate.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client actions such as delete, renew, transfer, and update are prohibited. This could be a red flag, but it is not necessarily indicative of fraud without further context. The domain is also DNSSEC unsigned, which is not uncommon and does not inherently indicate fraud.",
