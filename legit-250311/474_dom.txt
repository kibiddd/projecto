  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2007-06-26 and is expiring soon on 2025-06-26. This is a red flag for potential fraud as it is an unusually long registration period for a domain that is expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@godaddy.com and 480-624-2505) is not redacted or partial, and it appears to be legitimate. There are no suspicious elements in the contact information provided.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that GoDaddy hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client actions such as deletion, renewal, transfer, and update are prohibited. This could be a sign of a domain that is being managed by a third party or is under some form of restriction. However, without additional context, it is not a definitive indicator of fraud.",
