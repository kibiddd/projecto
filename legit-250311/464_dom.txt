  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2003-12-01, which is over 22 years ago, so it is not recent. The expiration date is 2026-12-01, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or partial. The contact information for the registrar is also provided.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common restriction for domains managed by GoDaddy. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag, as many domains do not use DNSSEC. The last update of the WHOIS database was on 2025-03-11, which is recent, but this does not indicate any suspicious activity.",
