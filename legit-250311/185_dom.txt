  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "MarkMonitor Inc. is a reputable registrar known for hosting legitimate domains. There is no indication that this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
