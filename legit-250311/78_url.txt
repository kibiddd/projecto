  "TLD": "The TLD '.com' is a common and trusted TLD, so it does not indicate a high risk.",
  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters. It follows a standard URL structure.",
  "Other": "The URL contains a business profile link, which is not inherently suspicious. However, the deceptive domain name is a red flag.",
