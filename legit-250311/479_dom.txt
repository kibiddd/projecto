  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2009-10-31 and the registration information was last updated on 2024-12-01. This means the domain has been registered for over 15 years, which is not recent. The domain is not expiring soon as the expiration date is 2026-01-01, which is more than a year away. Therefore, the domain is neither recent nor expiring soon.",

The domain has been registered for a long time and is not expiring soon, which is typical for established domains.",
