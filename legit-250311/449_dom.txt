  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2002-01-13 and is not expiring soon, as the expiration date is 2026-01-13. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The registrar and contact information are clearly listed, which is a positive indicator against fraud.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that GoDaddy hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. This factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client actions such as deletion, renewal, transfer, and update are prohibited. This could be a red flag, as it may suggest that the domain is being managed by someone who wants to prevent changes to the domain's ownership or status. However, without additional context, it is not a definitive indicator of fraud.",
