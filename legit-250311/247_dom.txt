  "answer1": "The domain was created on 1996-05-28 and is expiring on 2025-05-27, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided and appears legitimate.",
  "answer3": "MarkMonitor Inc. is a well-known registrar and does not have a reputation for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual and could be a red flag. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not a common practice for legitimate domains. These factors could potentially indicate fraudulent activity.",
