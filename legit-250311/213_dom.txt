  "answer3": "MarkMonitor Inc. is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, and clientUpdateProhibited. This means that the domain cannot be deleted, transferred, or updated by the current registrant.
