  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2004-01-09, which is over 21 years ago, so it is not recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The registrant, admin, and tech contact information is redacted for privacy, which is common but can also be a red flag for fraud if combined with other suspicious factors.",
  "answer3": "DreamHost, LLC is a well-known registrar, but without specific information on their reputation for hosting malicious sites, it's difficult to assess this factor definitively. However, DreamHost is generally considered a reputable registrar.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a legitimate restriction or a sign of a domain that is not actively managed. The domain is also DNSSEC unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator but could be a security concern.",
