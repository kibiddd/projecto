  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that GoDaddy hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDeleteProhibited, clientRenewProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, and clientUpdateProhibited.
