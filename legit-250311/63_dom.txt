  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2005-03-17 and is expiring on 2025-03-17, which is more than 19 years from now. Therefore, it is not recent nor expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (Tucows Domains Inc.) is complete and not redacted or partial.",
  "answer3": "Tucows Domains Inc. is a well-known registrar and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. The registrar's abuse contact email and phone number are provided, which suggests a legitimate operation.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers and updates are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains managed by the original owner or a trusted party. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily suspicious but could be a security concern. The last update of the whois database was on 2025-03-11, which is recent, but this does not indicate fraud.",
