  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2010-08-21 and the registration is expiring on 2025-08-21, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not recent nor expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (trustandsafety@support.aws.com and +1.2024422253) is not redacted, partial, or suspicious. It appears to be legitimate.",
  "answer3": "Amazon Registrar, Inc. is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual but not necessarily indicative of fraud. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is a security concern but not necessarily fraudulent. The WHOIS data was last updated on 2025-03-11, which is recent, but the domain itself is not recent. The URL provided is for a WHOIS Inaccuracy Complaint Form, which is a standard feature and not suspicious.",
