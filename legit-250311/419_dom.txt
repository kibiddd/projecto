  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2007-06-09 and the registration is expiring on 2025-06-09, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is expiring soon, which is a potential fraud indicator.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided and does not raise any immediate concerns.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Namespro Solutions Inc., is not known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. The registrar's abuse contact email and phone number are provided, which suggests that they are not hiding their contact information.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice to prevent unauthorized transfers. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator, but it could be a security concern. The name servers are hosted by SMOKYHOSTS.NET, which is a legitimate hosting provider. No other suspicious registration factors are apparent.",
