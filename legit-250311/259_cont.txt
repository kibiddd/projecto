  "Phishing": "The website requests users to identify all the Bobs in pictures and enter them in a form to win free merchandise. While it doesn't directly ask for payment information, the request for personal information (likely including email and shipping address) could be a precursor to phishing if the site is compromised or malicious actors gain access to the collected data.",
  "Suspicious offer": "Offering free personalized merchandise (T-shirt and coffee mug) for identifying Bobs, without any apparent cost to the user, is a suspicious offer that might be a way to collect personal information or lure users to other malicious activities. The site claims that anyone who can identify all the Bobs will win, which is a bold claim. This type of 'contest' can be a way to attract a larger user base for malicious intentions.",
  "Format": "The website has a basic design, but this isn't inherently a red flag. However, the image quality is low, and the overall appearance is outdated, which could be seen as a sign of either an old, maintained site or a site quickly made with little effort. The text formatting seems okay. It's not a polished-looking site.",
  "Transparency": "The website doesn't include detailed contact information such as phone numbers. However, the website appears to have an email or contact form as it encourages viewers to submit an entry with rules and regulations.",
  "Impersonation": "N/A",
  "Other": "The website promotes the sale of merchandise. It is unclear if these products will be delivered. The website also appears to have several links within the main page; the main page is not a dedicated product selling page, so the overall layout of the website appears unorganized. ",
