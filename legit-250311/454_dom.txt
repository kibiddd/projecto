  "answer1": "The domain RAGWAGON.COM was created on 2018-09-25 and has an expiration date of 2025-09-25, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator as it may be a short-term registration often used for phishing or other malicious activities.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (TurnCommerce, Inc. DBA NameBright.com) includes an abuse contact email (support@namebright.com) and phone number (17204960020). The contact information does not appear to be redacted or partial, and it seems legitimate. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, TurnCommerce, Inc. DBA NameBright.com, is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. This is a significant red flag as it suggests that the registrar may not have stringent policies in place to prevent the registration of fraudulent domains. This factor strongly indicates potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "Other suspicious registration factors include the domain status being 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a tactic used by fraudulent operators to prevent domain recovery. Additionally, the domain's DNSSEC is unsigned, which is unusual for a legitimate domain and could indicate a lack of security measures. These factors further support the potential for fraud.",
  "verdict": 8
