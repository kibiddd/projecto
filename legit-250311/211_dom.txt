  "answer1": "The domain was created on 1997-04-24, which is far beyond the 6-month threshold. It is not recent. The expiration date is 2027-04-25, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or partial. The contact information for the registrar is also provided.",
  "answer3": "Network Solutions, LLC is a well-known registrar, but it has been associated with hosting malicious sites in the past. However, it is also a legitimate registrar, so this factor alone is not conclusive.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains with sensitive or high-profile content. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag, as many domains do not use DNSSEC. The registrar's abuse contact information is provided, which is a positive sign. No other suspicious registration factors are apparent.",
