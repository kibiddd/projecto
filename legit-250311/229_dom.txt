  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, NameCheap, Inc., is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains with a high level of security or privacy concerns. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag, as many domains choose not to use DNSSEC. The last update of the WHOIS database was on 2025-03-11, which is very recent, but this alone does not indicate fraud.",
