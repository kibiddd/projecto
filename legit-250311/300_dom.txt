  "answer3": "MarkMonitor Inc. is a reputable registrar known for hosting a variety of domains, including those of large corporations and government entities. There is no indication that this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status includes several prohibitions such as clientDeleteProhibited, serverDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, serverTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited, and serverUpdateProhibited.
