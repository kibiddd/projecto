  "answer1": "The domain was created on 1999-04-12 and the registration is expiring on 2025-04-12, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator as it may be a short-term registration often used for malicious purposes.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, which is a good sign.",
  "answer3": "GoDaddy.com, LLC is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that GoDaddy hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client actions such as delete, renew, transfer, and update are prohibited. This could be a red flag, as it may suggest that the domain is being managed by someone who wants to prevent changes to the domain, which could be a tactic used by fraudsters to maintain control over the domain.",
