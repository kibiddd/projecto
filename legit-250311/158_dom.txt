  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 1998-07-06, which is well over 6 months ago. It is not expiring soon either, as the expiration date is 2025-07-05, which is more than a year away. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts is redacted for privacy. This is a common practice and does not necessarily indicate fraud. However, the lack of available contact information can be a red flag in some cases, as it makes it difficult to verify the legitimacy of the domain owner.",
  "answer3": "Network Solutions, LLC is a well-known registrar, but it has been associated with hosting malicious sites in the past. This could be a potential indicator of fraud, but it is not definitive proof of fraudulent activity. The domain itself is registered to the Kansas City Public Library, which is a legitimate organization, so this factor alone is not sufficient to conclude fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited. This is a common restriction for domains managed by libraries, educational institutions, or other organizations that do not want their domains to be transferred to other parties. This factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "verdict": 2
