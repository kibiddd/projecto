  "answer1": "The domain was created on 1996-05-20, which is far beyond the 6-month threshold for recent registration. It is also not expiring soon, as the expiration date is 2027-12-11, which is more than a year away. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, which is a good sign of transparency.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, eNom, LLC, is a well-known registrar and does not have a reputation for hosting malicious sites. The domain status is 'ok' according to ICANN, which is a positive indicator. However, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag for fraud but could be a security concern. The registrar's reputation does not indicate a high likelihood of fraud.",
  "answer4": "There are no other suspicious registration factors mentioned in the provided information.",
