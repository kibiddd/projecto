  "Summary": "The website, hockey-reference.com, is a legitimate sports statistics website that provides detailed information about hockey teams, players, and games. The URL, domain registration, and screenshot analysis all indicate that it is not a scam website. The domain was created in 2000 and is not expiring soon, and the Amazon Registrar, Inc. is a reputable registrar. The website does not request any personal information or payment, and it has a professional design with high-quality images. The website provides clear contact information and does not appear to be impersonating another entity. The only potential risk is that the domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual and could be a red flag. However, this alone is not necessarily indicative of fraud.",
