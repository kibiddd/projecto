  "Phishing": "The website presents a security check before allowing a download, which is a common tactic, but it's not inherently phishing. It is asking the user to prove that they are a human, but not asking for any personal information.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The website promises 'privacy-first browsing' and 'digital freedom', which could be a marketing tactic but doesn't indicate an obviously fraudulent offer.",
