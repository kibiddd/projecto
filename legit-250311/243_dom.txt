  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2015-10-25 and is expiring on 2025-10-25, which is more than 6 months from the current date of 2025-03-07. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of being recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or partial. All relevant contact information is available.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Domainhawks.net LLC, is listed as a WHOIS server for the domain. However, there is no direct information provided about whether this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacks verification. Further research would be needed to determine this.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which could be a red flag depending on the context. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not inherently suspicious but could be a concern depending on the domain's use case. The registrar's WHOIS server is listed as 'whois.web.com', which is a generic WHOIS server and not necessarily indicative of malicious activity. However, the domain's registration and expiration dates are consistent, which does not raise immediate suspicion.",
