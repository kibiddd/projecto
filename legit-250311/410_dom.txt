  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 1995-05-09 and is expiring in 2025-05-10, which is more than 6 months away. Therefore, it is not recent and not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "MarkMonitor Inc. is a well-known registrar and is not typically associated with hosting malicious sites. However, the domain status indicates that client actions such as deletion, transfer, and update are prohibited, which could be a red flag depending on the context. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not inherently suspicious but could be a concern if the domain is expected to have DNSSEC records.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicating client actions are prohibited could be a suspicious factor if the domain is not managed by the legitimate owner and is instead being used for malicious purposes. The unsigned DNSSEC could also be a concern if the domain is expected to have DNSSEC records.",
