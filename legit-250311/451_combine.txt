  "Summary": "The website URL, domain registration, and screenshot analysis indicate that the website is a legitimate Facebook page. The URL is a standard Facebook URL, the domain registration is not recent but not suspicious, and the screenshot shows a genuine Facebook login page. However, there is a potential risk of impersonation, as attackers could replicate the look of a legitimate Facebook page. The final verdict is 1, indicating that it is very unlikely to be a scam website.",
