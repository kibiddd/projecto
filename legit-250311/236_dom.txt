  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, which is a positive sign.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, CSC Corporate Domains, Inc., is known for hosting domains for various businesses and does not have a reputation for hosting malicious sites.

  "answer4": "The domain is relatively old, having been created in 1999, and is expiring soon. The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which could be a red flag if the domain is being transferred to a fraudulent entity. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator but could be a security concern.",
