    "No direct brand impersonation.",
    "`.weebly.com` is a legitimate service but often used for hosting less reputable sites, raising suspicion.",
    "Unusual use of subdomain `carlsbadrotaryfoundation` on a free hosting platform.  Legitimate organizations often use their own domain.",
    "The combination of a subdomain and a free hosting service increases risk. While Carlsbad Rotary Foundation may be legitimate, this structure is commonly exploited for phishing."
