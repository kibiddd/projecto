    "No obvious brand impersonation.",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD (part of loto-quebec.com).",
    "Multiple subdomains and query parameters are present.  While not inherently malicious, such patterns warrant closer inspection.",
    "The URL leverages a legitimate organization (loto-quebec.com), reducing risk. The length and query parameters slightly increase suspicion."
