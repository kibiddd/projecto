    "No obvious brand impersonation detected.",

    "The URL contains a long, specific path with numbers and special characters, which could be legitimate but is slightly suspicious.  The presence of 'bristol-myers-squibb-canada-campaign' suggests potential marketing, however the numbers at the end raise concern.",
    "The overall structure seems more complex than typical phishing attempts, but the extended path length raises mild concern. Using marketing language 'take-action' and potentially using an existing campaign may try to build legitimacy."
