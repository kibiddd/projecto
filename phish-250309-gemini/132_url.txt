  "Explanation": [
    "Uses 'auth--crypto-sso' which is a suspicious subdomain pattern attempting to mimic a legitimate service.",
    "webflow.io is often used for temporary or free websites, increasing risk.",
    "Excessive use of subdomains ('auth', 'crypto-sso', 'x-cdn') is highly suspicious.",
    "URL uses https, lowering the score slightly, but not enough to mitigate the other red flags."
