    "No direct brand impersonation, but subdomain use could be deceptive.",
    ".co.uk is a generally low-risk TLD, but the long subdomain chain raises suspicion.",
    "Excessive subdomains (help-center-case-id-1000198718125) is a red flag, often used to make the URL appear legitimate while obscuring the true domain. The inclusion of a seemingly random 'case-id' further supports this.",
    "The subdomain 'chrisstanton' appears to be a personal domain and is not related to the initial subdomain and top-level domain. This is highly suspicious and suggests an attempt to piggyback on a legitimate domain or create a misleading association with the initial portion of the URL.",
    "URL uses https"
