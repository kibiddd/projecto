    "No obvious brand impersonation.",
    "vpndns.net is a suspicious subdomain, often associated with proxy/VPN services used to mask the true origin of the site and potentially malicious activity.",
    "Excessive and highly irregular subdomain/path structure: This pattern of deep nesting with seemingly random names is a strong indicator of phishing or malicious activity.  The URL is designed to be difficult to parse and understand, and the structure is not typical of legitimate websites.",
    "URL uses https, but the other factors are highly suspicious."
