    "Uses character substitution/insertion ('--' in place of '.' to attempt to mimic a legitimate URL structure).",
    "webflow.io is a relatively low-trust TLD/domain, frequently used by both legitimate businesses and for phishing/scam websites.",
    "Excessive use of subdomains ('help--index') is highly suspicious.",
    "The overall structure attempts to appear as though it is part of a legitimate site, but the subdomain structure suggests it is a scam."
