    "No direct brand impersonation, but the subdomain 'archive.com' could be attempting to mimic a legitimate archiving service.",
    ".im (Isle of Man) is a country code TLD. While not inherently high-risk, the combination with 'archive.com' raises suspicion, especially given the context of Instagram.",
    "Excessive subdomains (instagram.archive.com) are suspicious and could be used to obfuscate the true origin of the link.",
    "The path '/video/657475766' is generic but could be used to lead to a phishing page.",
    "URL uses https"
