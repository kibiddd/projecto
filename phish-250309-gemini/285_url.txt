  "verdict": 9,
  "Explanation": [
    "No direct brand impersonation, but the excessive subdomain structure and the mix of seemingly random strings and numbers (musclebbcoerlparmotiondetectiontwofiveemp1.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/13033l/developweb1194.z33.web.core.windows.net) raise significant suspicion.",
    "While .com is generally low risk, the layering of multiple subdomains and the final domain (web.core.windows.net) being a legitimate service, but often abused, increases risk.",
    "Suspicious pattern: extremely long and complex subdomain structure. The path 'index.html' is very generic and could be used for a landing page.",
    "URL uses https."
