    "No direct brand impersonation.",
    "workers.dev is a subdomain of Cloudflare Workers, which can be used for malicious purposes. While not inherently high-risk, it can host phishing sites.",
    "Excessive subdomain and URL path contains a very long random string, highly suspicious.",
    "URL uses https",
    "The URL path '/common/reprocess' and the query parameters (with the very long, random string) are not typical and suggest a phishing or malicious intent. This type of URL is designed to be unique and difficult to analyze."
