    "No direct brand impersonation detected.",
    "`.app` is generally a low-risk TLD, but `vercel.app` suggests use of a free hosting service, sometimes used for scams.",
    "Suspicious pattern: a random-looking subdomain ('groussuttoigatra-4516') combined with a potentially generic path ('mixcc.html') raises suspicion. The subdomain looks like a randomly generated identifier.",
    "URL uses https"
