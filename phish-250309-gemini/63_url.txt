    "No obvious brand impersonation in the domain.",
    "TLD '.help' is of moderate risk, often used for short-lived sites and can be associated with scams.",
    "The domain uses an excessive number of subdomains (info.loginhelp). This is a suspicious pattern.",
    "The URL uses http, raising the risk significantly."
