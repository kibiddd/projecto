    "Uses 'triezorhardwre' with a character substitution to mimic 'trezorhardware'",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD (often used for legitimate purposes, but also for temporary/impersonation sites)",
    "Excessive subdomain usage: 'help-triezorhardwre-sso' is suspicious and suggests an attempt to appear legitimate through a subdomain.",
    "Other anomalies: This domain structure is often used by phishing sites to leverage free hosting."
