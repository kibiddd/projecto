    "URL uses https",
    "workers.dev is a medium-risk TLD (associated with Cloudflare Workers, often used for temporary or suspicious sites)",
    "Excessive subdomain 'checkwhat.m1croshort'",
    "Suspiciously long query string with a mix of seemingly random characters, numbers, and encoded data; common in phishing attempts to hide malicious payloads or bypass filtering.",
    "The combination of subdomain and query string strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity."
