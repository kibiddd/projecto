    "URL uses https",
    ".github.io is a low-risk TLD (often used for legitimate project hosting, but can be abused)",
    "Path contains 'netflix' which could be impersonation, but likely a project",
    "Uses 'jlka101' - suspicious account name, but GitHub is a legitimate platform, and this might be the user's name."
