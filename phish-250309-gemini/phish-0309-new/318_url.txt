    "URL uses https",
    "github.io is a generally low-risk TLD but associated with free hosting, making it easier for malicious actors to set up temporary sites.",
    "Path 'Netflix-Home' is likely a clone project attempting to impersonate the Netflix login page.",
    "The username 'prakansh07' does not have any relation with Netflix",
    "The combination of a Netflix related path hosted on a free hosting service like GitHub is highly suspicious."
