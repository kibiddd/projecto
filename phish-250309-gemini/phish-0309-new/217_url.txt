    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium risk TLD (often used for legitimate sites, but also abused)",
    "Suspicious subdomain structure: 'gemini-login-cdn'. While 'cdn' can be legitimate, the combination with 'gemini-login' is highly suggestive of credential phishing, especially targeting a cryptocurrency exchange.",
    "Likely brand impersonation (Gemini). The subdomain attempts to look like a legitimate Gemini login portal."
