    ".mt (Malta) is a moderate-risk TLD, often used for short URLs.",
    "Suspicious pattern: The URL consists of a domain and a short, seemingly random string ('9jL'), which is typical of URL shorteners and can be used to hide the true destination.",
    "No immediate brand impersonation detected.",
