    "URL uses https",
    ".webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD as it is commonly used for temporary or test websites, and less frequently for official business",
    "Excessive use of hyphens ('---') in the subdomain is highly suspicious and a common tactic for hiding or obfuscating the true domain, likely impersonating 'ledger'",
    "The URL attempts to mimic a legitimate Ledger support or content subdomain through a substitution with 'help---content---' before the brand name"
