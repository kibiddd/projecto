    "'.com' is a low-risk TLD, but the subdomain 'ubpages.com' is suspicious, indicating a potential free or low-cost hosting service often abused by phishers.",
    "The subdomain 'loginnscreen' raises a red flag due to its relation to login screens.",
    "The path '/1cc0658f-ff8e-4f7b-bac0-21fb0b551ab9' is a random string, a common pattern for phishing pages."
