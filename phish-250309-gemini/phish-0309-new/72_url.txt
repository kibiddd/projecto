    "URL uses http",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD, but the subdomain m. is concerning with an IP based URL.",
    "The subdomain 'm' could be an attempt to mimic a mobile version of a legitimate site. The combination of the subdomain and IP address adds risk.",
    "The numerical subdomain '060d' is highly suspicious and indicates a potential attempt to obfuscate the true destination or impersonate a brand."
