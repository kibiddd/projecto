    "URL uses https",
    ".dev is a medium-risk TLD (associated with Google's Pages platform, often used for temporary/testing sites, and can be prone to abuse).",
    "The URL uses a seemingly random string of numbers (17952401) appended to the path, which is suspicious.",
    "The use of 'carrefouriramadan2' may be a social engineering tactic, capitalizing on the Ramadan holiday to target users. Combining the brand (Carrefour) with a timely event is a common phishing strategy.",
    "Uses Google Pages, which can host illegitimate sites."
