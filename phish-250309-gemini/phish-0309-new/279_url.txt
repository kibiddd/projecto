    "URL uses https",
    "wixsite.com is a medium risk TLD, often used for free websites and may be used for phishing.",
    "The subdomain 'maryannarw62111111' contains a long string of numbers, which is suspicious.",
    "The URL path '/so/2aPLpUXjr' and query parameters including 'cid' and 'languageTag' appear to be randomly generated and are suspicious.",
    "The combination of a free website host, a long numeric subdomain, and a seemingly random URL structure raises significant concerns."
