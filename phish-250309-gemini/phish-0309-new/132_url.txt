    "URL uses https",
    ".io is a moderately risky TLD, often used for legitimate projects but also sometimes for less reputable ones.",
    "The excessive use of subdomains ('auth', 'crypto-sso', 'x-cdn') is suspicious, especially when combined with the potential for brand impersonation.",
    "The URL structure suggests a possible attempt to mimic a legitimate authentication or CDN service related to cryptocurrency, which are frequent targets for phishing."
