    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a moderate-risk TLD, often used for temporary or personal sites, which are sometimes used for malicious purposes",
    "Suspicious subdomain: 'auth-s-started-traizor' is a long and unusual string, potentially designed to appear legitimate at a glance but ultimately random",
    "The subdomain contains keywords related to authentication, making it likely to be used in credential phishing."
