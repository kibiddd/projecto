    "URL uses https",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD, but repeated for suspicion",
    "Subdomain 'www' is common and not inherently suspicious",
    "The domain is 'anelectriciancom.com' which is suspicious due to not using spaces (an electrician.com)",
    "The path '/answer/index.php' could be a generic path used for deceptive purposes"
