    "URL uses http",
    "`.dev` is a moderate-risk TLD (often used for development/testing and can be less trustworthy in a production context)",
    "The use of 'pages.dev' is associated with Google Cloud's hosting service, and while legitimate, it's often exploited by phishers due to its ease of setup and lack of strict verification.",
    "No obvious brand impersonation, but the context of `dethex` is unknown and could be used for malicious activity"
