    "URL uses http",
    "weebly.com is a low-risk TLD, but the use of a free subdomain increases risk",
    "btinformationserver is a generic-sounding name and could be used for phishing",
    "Use of a free website builder (weebly.com) is common in phishing campaigns",
     "No direct brand impersonation, but the generic nature and free hosting are red flags"
