    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD, often used for temporary or rapidly deployed sites",
    "Excessive subdomains (nav---sso--coinbasepro--cdn--w----auth) is a suspicious pattern, likely attempting to mimic a legitimate service through subdomain manipulation and confuse users",
    "The inclusion of 'coinbasepro' in the subdomain strongly suggests brand impersonation, possibly targeting Coinbase Pro users."
