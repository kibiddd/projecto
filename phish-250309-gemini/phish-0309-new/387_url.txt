    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD (often used for temporary or unverified sites)",
    "Excessive use of subdomains (sso-auth--i-o-ca-ndax) suggests potential attempt to obfuscate the actual domain",
    "Subdomain structure might be attempting to mimic a legitimate SSO (Single Sign-On) service and impersonate multiple brands/entities (i, o, ca, ndax are possible brand prefixes)",
    "Presence of 'auth' in the subdomain is a red flag as it commonly used in phishing URLs"
