    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD, often used for free or temporary sites, increasing the risk of scams or testing grounds",
    "Suspicious use of excessive hyphens ('www-secure--trezrs') to obfuscate the real domain and appear legitimate",
    "Likely a brand impersonation attempt of Trezor, adding extra hyphens to confuse the user"
