    "URL uses http",
    "trycloudflare.com is a high-risk TLD as it is often used for free hosting and can be abused.",
    "The domain name is nonsensical and contains multiple hyphens, indicating it's likely a randomly generated or suspicious domain.",
    "The domain name uses 'chinese-induced-societies-readings', this suggests it could be used to target people with a certain interest, so it seems malicious."
