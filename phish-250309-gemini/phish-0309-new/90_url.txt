    "URL uses http",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD but is being used with a suspicious name",
    "The domain name 'reviewsec-nab' is suspicious as it tries to impersonate a security review site. 'nab' might be a brand name which the URL is trying to imitate. This uses a dash which is a common tactic for brand impersonation."
