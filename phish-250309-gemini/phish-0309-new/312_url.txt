    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD, often used for temporary or quickly-spun-up websites, increasing risk.",
    "Excessive subdomains and hyphens ('portal-led-ger----live-cdn') are a red flag, likely an attempt to obscure the true destination and mimic a legitimate service (Ledger).",
    "The use of 'live' and 'cdn' along with the brand name 'Ledger' suggests a likely attempt at brand impersonation of Ledger, a cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider."
