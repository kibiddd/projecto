    "URL uses http",
    "godaddysites.com is a medium-risk subdomain, often used for temporary or less secure sites.",
    "Uses 'gemiani-logain', possibly a typo-squatting attempt or brand impersonation.",
    "Likely attempting to impersonate Gemini (based on 'gemiani').",
    "The combination of http and suspicious subdomain raises red flags."
