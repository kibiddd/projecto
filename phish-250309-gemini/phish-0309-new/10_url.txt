    "URL uses http",
    "io is a medium-risk TLD (can be used for legitimate services but also for scams)",
    "Excessive use of subdomains (app--secure-blockfi--apps--cdn) is highly suspicious and likely designed to mimic a legitimate BlockFi service or other well-known brand. The multiple hyphens further add to the risk.",
    "The structure strongly suggests an attempt to impersonate a secure application associated with BlockFi, while likely being a clone project."
