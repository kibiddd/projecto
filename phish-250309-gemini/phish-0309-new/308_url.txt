    "URL uses https",
    ".io is a moderately risky TLD, often used for tech startups but can be abused.",
    "Excessive subdomains ('portal-app-ndax-io----cdn-x-cdn') are highly suspicious and likely attempt to obscure the true origin.",
    "Pattern suggests impersonation of a legitimate service by using multiple subdomains to make the URL appear complex and trustworthy."
