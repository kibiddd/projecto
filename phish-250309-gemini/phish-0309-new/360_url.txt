    "Excessive subdomains (secure-sso--ndaxx-sso) are a red flag, especially if they are attempting to impersonate a legitimate service.",
    "Likely attempting to impersonate a 'sso' (single sign on) service for ndaxx, a specific financial or tech brand. The double hyphen in the subdomain is highly suspicious and is frequently used to bypass security protocols."
