    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD (can be used for legitimate sites, but often for temporary or free sites which are abused)",
    "Suspicious subdomain: 'help-triezorhardwre-sso' likely attempts to impersonate legitimate Trezor Hardware help or SSO (Single Sign-On) service and uses misspelling",
    "The combination of 'help', 'Trezor', 'hardware', and 'sso' is highly suggestive of a phishing attempt targeting Trezor users."
