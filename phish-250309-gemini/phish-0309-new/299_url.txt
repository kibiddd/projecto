    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium risk TLD (often used for temporary or free sites)",
    "Suspicious subdomain structure: page-sso-auth-ndaxlogi.  The inclusion of 'sso-auth' is commonly associated with login pages, a prime target for phishing.",
    "The combination of 'ndaxlogi' is unusual and may be an attempt at brand impersonation (NDAX?).",
    "Uses a free hosting platform which lowers the trust of this URL"
