    "URL uses http",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD (often used for free/temporary sites, but not inherently malicious)",
    "Excessive subdomains (sso-uphold-com-cdnn-auth-en-usa) are highly suspicious and a common phishing tactic to appear legitimate",
    "The URL attempts to impersonate 'uphold.com' through subdomain manipulation, likely for credential theft."
