    "URL uses http",
    "webflow.io is a moderately risky TLD, often used for temporary or unverified sites, especially when combined with unusual subdomain structure.",
    "The use of multiple subdomains 'base-ndaxx-help' raises suspicion.  The subdomain structure looks odd and potentially indicative of a phishing attempt or a hastily constructed site.",
    "The subdomain 'ndaxx' could be an attempt at brand impersonation.  The overall structure feels thrown together, indicating potentially malicious intent."
