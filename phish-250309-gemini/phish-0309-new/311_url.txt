    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium risk TLD, often used for temporary or less established websites, increasing the likelihood of hosting malicious content",
    "Excessive subdomains (portal, coinbasepro, cdn-e, auth) are often a sign of an attempt to appear legitimate by mimicking a known brand or service through subdomain spoofing.",
    "The subdomain structure 'portal--coinbasepro--cdn-e--auth' suggests an attempt to impersonate Coinbase Pro by using multiple components separated by hyphens, a common tactic for phishing attacks."
