    "URL uses https",
    "weeblysite.com is a medium-risk TLD (free website platforms are often abused)",
    "Suspicious pattern: excessive numbers and hyphens in subdomain (my-site-107934-102452). This is a common tactic to evade blocklists and appear less suspicious at first glance.",
    "Other anomaly: Use of a free website platform increases risk."
