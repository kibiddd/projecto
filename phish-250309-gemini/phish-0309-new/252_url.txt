    ".fr (France) is a low-risk TLD",
    "The URL mimics the French tax authority (impots.gouv) which is a common target for phishing, particularly with the inclusion of 'particuliers' indicating a focus on individual taxpayers.",
    "The path '/static/erreur.html' might be used to create a sense of urgency and error reporting to prompt users to take action."
