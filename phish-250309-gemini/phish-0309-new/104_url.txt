    "URL uses https",
    "vpndns.net is a high-risk TLD (often associated with temporary or malicious sites)",
    "Extremely suspicious pattern: excessive subdomains and seemingly random strings in the path (e.g., michelle.galichon, marie-line.laplagne). This suggests an attempt to obfuscate the true destination or create a false directory structure to mimic legitimate content or evade detection.",
    "The path structure is highly unusual and unlikely for any legitimate website. The repetition and structure point towards automated URL generation for phishing or malware distribution."
