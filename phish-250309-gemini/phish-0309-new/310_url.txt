    "URL uses https",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD (can be used for legitimate purposes but also for hosting phishing sites)",
    "Excessive subdomains: 'portal-coinbasepro--cdn-e--auth-cdn'. This is a common tactic to make the URL appear legitimate at first glance (coinbasepro), while the actual content resides on the subdomain.",
    "The subdomain structure strongly suggests an attempt to impersonate Coinbase Pro. The inclusion of 'portal' and 'auth-cdn' are designed to look like legitimate Coinbase components."
