  "Explanation": [
    "URL uses https",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD",
    "Suspicious pattern: The URL contains a long, seemingly random string of characters and numbers after 'rdr/'. This is a common technique to obfuscate the true destination and potentially track user clicks or pass malicious data.",
    "The use of a CDN (cdn.mediacodehub.com) is not inherently malicious but can be used to distribute phishing content or hide the actual source of the page.",
    "The combination of a legitimate-looking domain with a suspicious-looking path raises significant concern."
