    "URL uses http",
    "webflow.io is a generally lower risk TLD but can be abused",
    "Excessive subdomains (sso-ca-ndax-sso-auth) are suspicious and could be used to mislead users into thinking it's a legitimate service (e.g., SSO for a Canadian NDax exchange)",
    "Uses subdomains and hyphenation to attempt brand impersonation. Could be trying to impersonate a financial institution like NDax"
