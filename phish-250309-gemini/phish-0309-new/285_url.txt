    "URL uses https",
    "The long and complex subdomain structure (musclebbcoerlparmotiondetectiontwofiveemp1.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/13033l/developweb1194.z33.web.core.windows.net) is highly suspicious and designed to evade detection.",
    "Uses .com which is a low-risk TLD",
    "Random-looking strings and numbers in subdomains and path (e.g., '13033l', 'developweb1194', 'z33') are characteristic of phishing attempts.",
    "Uses a 'cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com' domain, that can be used to host malicious content."
