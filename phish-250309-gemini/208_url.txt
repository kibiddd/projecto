    "No direct brand impersonation, but potential for impersonation through the context of 'Clone-Instagram'",
    ".github.io is a medium-risk TLD; often used for legitimate purposes, but also for hosting phishing sites.",
    "The path 'Clone-Instagram' strongly suggests an attempt to mimic the Instagram platform.",
    "The use of a personal GitHub Pages domain increases risk, as these are easily created and often lack robust security compared to established platforms."
