    "No direct brand impersonation in the domain.",
    ".com is a low-risk TLD.",
    "The URL contains a random-looking string of characters in the path, which is often used for tracking or obfuscation, but can also be used to hide malicious content.",
    "Excessive subdomain use, potentially for cloaking or redirection. The cdn subdomain is often used for legitimate purposes, but the length and complexity of the rdr path suggest unusual behavior.",
    "No HTTP usage, so no added risk there. Other anomalies: excessive subdomain use coupled with a long seemingly random path."
