    "Uses 'anthem' with no immediate impersonation",
    "synology.me is a suspicious subdomain and TLD combination. '.me' TLDs are sometimes used for legitimate purposes, but the use of a free subdomain like 'synology.me' raises suspicion in conjunction with an established brand like 'Anthem'",
    "No immediately obvious suspicious path patterns.",
    "URL uses https, which lowers the score slightly"
