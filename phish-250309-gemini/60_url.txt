    "Uses 'coinbase-cdn-doc-io' which could be attempting to mimic Coinbase through subdomain manipulation.",
    ".io is a medium risk TLD (but webflow.io is a legitimate platform used for hosting websites, so lower than other high risk TLDs).",
    "The combination of multiple subdomains and the inclusion of terms like 'cdn' and 'doc' can be an attempt to feign legitimacy.",
