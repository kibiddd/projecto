    "No obvious brand impersonation.",
    ".co.uk is a generally trusted TLD, but the subdomain structure is suspicious.",
    "The combination of 'case-id' followed by a long numeric string and seemingly unrelated query parameters ('helpbusiness') raises suspicion.",
    "The subdomain 'case-id-100016326' followed by 'dafea' is not a typical or expected pattern, potentially used to bypass security filters."
