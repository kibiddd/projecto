    "No direct brand impersonation, but the structure mimics a legitimate service portal.",
    "webflow.io is a medium-risk TLD/domain; often used for legitimate sites, but also for hosting phishing pages due to ease of setup and potential lack of rigorous screening.",
    "The subdomain pattern 'home-login-blockfi' is highly suspicious. It attempts to create the impression of a BlockFi login page, hinting at credential theft.",
    "While https is used, the other factors are highly indicative of a scam."
