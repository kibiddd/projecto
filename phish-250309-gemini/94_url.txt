  "Explanation": [
    "No brand impersonation detected.",
    "`.app` is a generally low-risk TLD, but the use of `vercel.app` can be used to host malicious sites and thus increases the risk.",
    "Extremely long and random subdomain (2t-kjeehsdfyiwoeujsf98esygufdijkenskfdl) is highly suspicious and a strong indicator of phishing.",
    "Other anomalies: The path '/lhqm.html' is very short and lacks context, potentially for credential harvesting or obfuscation."
