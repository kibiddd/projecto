  "Explanation": [
    "Uses 'auth-coinbase-pro' to mimic 'coinbase-pro'",
    "webflow.io is a generally lower-risk TLD, but the use of a subdomain is suspicious",
    "Subdomain structure (auth-coinbase-pro-ca-login) is excessive and suggests an attempt to appear legitimate through complexity, and also potentially impersonates Coinbase",
    "HTTPS used, but overall pattern is still highly suspicious"
  ]
