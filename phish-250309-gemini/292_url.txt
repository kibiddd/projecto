    "No direct brand impersonation.",
    "`.me` is a moderately risky TLD, often used for free hosting, and less established than .com or .org, potentially indicating higher risk.",
    "The URL uses a subdomain of 'glitch.me', a platform that allows anyone to quickly deploy a website, indicating a possible phishing risk",
    "The presence of a long, random-looking string 'BGghfLKP' in the path is a suspicious pattern.",
    "URL uses https."
