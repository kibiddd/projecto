    "no direct brand impersonation, but excessive use of hyphens and date-like strings could be used to make the site appear like an official communication",
    "weeblysite.com is a generally low-risk TLD, but the use of a free platform is often abused by malicious actors",
    "Suspicious pattern: Excessive subdomains and date format which could suggest temporal urgency or attempts to circumvent filtering.",
