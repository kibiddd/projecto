  "Phishing": "The website appears to be a Meta Help Center, which might involve requesting information to address user inquiries. Without more details on the specific information requested, it's hard to say if it is phishing. The presence of a 'request review' button could indicate that the website is collecting feedback or information, which is a normal practice for a customer service portal.",
  "Suspicious offer": "N/A. The website does not appear to be promoting a free product/service.",
  "Format": "The website appears to have a professional design, aligned with Meta branding. The images are of good quality, and there are no obvious typos.",
  "Transparency": "The website clearly displays Meta's branding, copyright information, and its purpose as a help center. However, the provided URL is a shortened one, which introduces some level of uncertainty since the destination of the short URL cannot be immediately verified. This, and the lack of explicit contact details raise a minor red flag.",
  "Impersonation": "The website impersonates Meta Help Center which increases the risk.",
  "Other": "The short URL used in the question is a suspicious factor as it hides the actual destination, potentially concealing a fraudulent website.",
