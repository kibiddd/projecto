  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2018-07-07 and the WHOIS database was last updated on 2025-03-10. This means the domain is older than 6 months but less than a year old, so it does not meet the criteria for being recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided (Registrar Abuse Contact Email and Phone) is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "Cloudflare, Inc. is a reputable registrar known for hosting many legitimate websites. There is no indication that Cloudflare is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client and server transfers, updates, and deletions are prohibited. This could be a security measure, but it is unusual and could be a red flag. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not typical for a domain with a long registration period. However, these factors alone do not strongly indicate fraud.",
