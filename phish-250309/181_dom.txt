  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent; it was created on 2008-07-29, which is well over 6 months ago. It is also not expiring soon; it expires on 2025-08-28, which is more than a year away. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant is redacted, which is a common practice for privacy reasons but can also be a red flag for potential fraud. However, without more context, it's not possible to definitively say if this is suspicious.",
  "answer3": "NIC Chile is a legitimate registrar, and there is no widely known information suggesting that they host malicious sites or lack verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain name 'clubpalestino.cl' does not inherently suggest any suspicious activity. However, the WHOIS information is restricted, which can sometimes be a tactic used by fraudulent domain owners to hide their identity. This could be a potential red flag, but without additional context, it's not definitive.",
