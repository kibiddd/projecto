  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2024-12-05 and the registration is expiring on 2025-12-05, which is less than a year from today (2025-03-07). This is a potential red flag for fraud as it indicates a very short registration period.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and there is no redacted or suspicious contact information. The registrar's contact details are also provided, which is a positive sign.",
  "answer3": "Gname.com is a well-known registrar, and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains with sensitive or high-value content. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator but could be a security concern. The name servers are from Cloudflare, which is a reputable service provider. No other suspicious registration factors are evident.",
