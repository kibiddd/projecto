  "Phishing": "The website doesn't seem to be directly requesting personal information or payment on this particular page. However, it is a landing page for Trezor products, and further navigation may lead to such requests. The 'Get your Trezor' button suggests a product purchase.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The website itself doesn't present a 'suspicious offer,' but the nature of the product (hardware wallet) and its association with cryptocurrencies can be a target for scams. One has to be careful about where a user ends up after clicking a button on the website.",
  "Format": "The website has a professional design and high-quality images. There are no noticeable typos.",
  "Transparency": "The website has a clear logo and mentions Trezor. It provides a link to the full Trezor Safe family, indicating that it is directly or indirectly associated with the brand. The footer, with the 'Made in Webflow' logo, can be a clue on where the site originated.",
  "Impersonation": "While the website itself appears legitimate, the URL 'www-secure--trezrs.webflow.io' is slightly suspicious. It includes a double dash and does not appear to be the official Trezor URL. This could be an attempt to impersonate the official site or domain.",
  "Other": "The URL combined with the brand name raises the most immediate concerns and prompts caution before any action or clicking on any link.",
