  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain contains a misspelling of 'auth' as 'auth-start'. This could be an attempt to deceive users into thinking the URL is legitimate.",
  "TLD": "The TLD '.io' is commonly used by legitimate companies, especially in the tech industry, but it can also be used by fraudulent sites. It is not inherently high-risk, but it is worth considering in the context of other factors.",
  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters. It appears to be a standard URL structure.",
  "Other": "The URL uses a subdomain ('webflow.io') which is a legitimate service, but the deceptive misspelling in the domain name could be a red flag.",
