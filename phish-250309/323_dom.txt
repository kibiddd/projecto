  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2013-04-22 and the registration is expiring on 2025-04-22, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not recent nor expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@namecheap.com and +1.6613102107) is not redacted or partial; it appears to be complete and legitimate.",
  "answer3": "NameCheap, Inc. is a well-known registrar and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. The registrar's abuse contact email and phone number are provided, which suggests a level of transparency and legitimacy.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This is a common restriction and not necessarily indicative of fraud. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not uncommon and does not necessarily indicate fraud. The domain name 'PROSYSTEMSUG.COM' is somewhat generic and could be used for legitimate purposes, but it could also be used for phishing or other malicious activities. However, without more specific indicators of fraud, this remains speculative.",
