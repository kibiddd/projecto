  "Transparency": "N/A",
  "Impersonation": "The URL is not the official Coinbase Pro domain. It's using a Webflow subdomain. It's possible that this is an imposter website.",
  "Other": "The URL itself is the biggest red flag. It's using a Webflow subdomain that might be used for hosting a legitimate website. However, the domain name 'portal-coinbasepro--cdn-e--auth-cdn' is very suspicious. It attempts to mimic legitimate Coinbase branding to mislead users. Therefore it is highly likely to be a scam website. ",
