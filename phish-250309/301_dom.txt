  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2023-02-08 and the registration is less than 6 months old. The domain is also set to expire in 2026, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided (Abuse Contact Email: hdung@nhanhoa.com and Phone: +84.2473086680) is not redacted or partial, and it appears to be legitimate. There are no suspicious elements in the contact information.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Nhan Hoa Software Company Ltd., is not known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. The registrar's WHOIS server and contact information are provided, which suggests a level of transparency.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This is a common restriction and not necessarily indicative of fraud. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not uncommon for smaller or less critical domains. No other suspicious registration factors are evident.",
