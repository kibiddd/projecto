  "Summary": "The website 'raisingrents.com' appears to be a legitimate domain with a common TLD and no deceptive domain patterns. However, the domain was created recently and is set to expire soon, which could be a potential fraud indicator. The registrar is known for hosting malicious sites, and the domain status indicates prohibited client transfers and an unsigned DNSSEC, which are both red flags. Unfortunately, a screenshot of the website could not be analyzed due to an error loading the website screenshot.",
