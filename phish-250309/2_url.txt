  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters. It appears to be a straightforward URL.",
  "Other": "The URL lacks additional suspicious factors such as HTTPS, a recognizable domain name, or a clear purpose. The numeric sequence in the domain name is the primary concern.",
