  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (NameCheap, Inc.) is complete and appears to be legitimate.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, NameCheap, Inc., is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
