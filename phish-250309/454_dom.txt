  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2024-05-06 and the registry expiry date is 2025-05-06. This means the domain is less than 6 months old and will expire in less than a year, which could be a potential fraud indicator as it might be a short-term registration often used for phishing or other malicious activities.",
  "answer2": "The registrant organization, registrant email, admin email, and tech email are all redacted or withheld for privacy. This lack of transparency in contact information is a common fraud indicator as it makes it difficult to verify the legitimacy of the domain owner.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Spaceship, Inc., is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. This is a significant fraud indicator as it suggests the domain might be managed by a registrar with a poor reputation for security and reliability.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a red flag if the domain owner is trying to lock in the domain with a registrar known for hosting malicious sites.",
