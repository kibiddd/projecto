  "Summary": "The website in question appears to be a phishing attempt, mimicking the Coinbase Pro login page. The URL contains a deceptive domain with a misspelled 'coinbasepro' and an unusual subdomain 'webflow.io'. The domain was registered over six months ago and is not expiring soon. The website has a professional design and layout, but the URL is the main issue, as it is not the official Coinbase domain. The screenshot analysis indicates that the website is trying to mimic the official Coinbase domain, which is a common tactic used by scammers. The potential risks include phishing attempts, where users may unknowingly provide their login credentials to the scammer, leading to unauthorized access to their accounts. The final verdict is 9, indicating a high likelihood of the website being a scam.",
