  "answer1": "The domain registration is recent, as it was created on 2006-03-29 and the updated date is 2024-12-10. The expiration date is 2025-03-28, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, including an abuse contact email and phone number.",
  "answer3": "SafeNames Ltd. is the registrar for the domain, and there is no information provided that suggests it is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual and could be a red flag. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not a common practice for domains that are actively managed and could indicate a lack of security measures. These factors could be considered suspicious.",
