  "answer2": "The contact information is not provided in the given information, so it cannot be assessed for being redacted, partial, or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "The registrar is 'whois.id', but there is no information provided about whether this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor cannot be assessed.",
