  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2024-04-13 and the registration is expiring on 2025-04-13, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07.

Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is another potential fraud indicator as it means the domain's DNS records are not secured.",
