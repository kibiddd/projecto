  "answer1": "The domain registration is recent, as it was created on 2006-03-29 and the WHOIS database was last updated on 2025-03-10. The domain is expiring soon, on 2025-03-28, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This is a potential fraud indicator as it suggests the domain may be set up for short-term use, possibly for phishing or other malicious activities.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@safenames.net and +44.1908200022) appears to be complete and not redacted or suspicious. Therefore, there are no immediate concerns regarding the contact information.",
  "answer3": "SafeNames Ltd. is the registrar, and there is no readily available information indicating that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lack verification. However, further investigation into the registrar's reputation and history would be necessary to make a definitive judgment.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual and could be a red flag. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is a security concern. These factors could be indicative of a domain set up for malicious purposes.",
