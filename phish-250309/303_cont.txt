  "Phishing": "The website is asking users to sign up for an account, which is a common phishing tactic to collect personal information. The website mimics the layout of a PayPal login page, increasing the chance of users providing sensitive data.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The website promotes a 'Sign Up for Free' offer. This is not inherently suspicious on its own, but combined with other factors, it raises concern.",
  "Format": "The website appears to be a blogspot site, using a generic layout and design. The URL contains a typo. This could be an attempt to impersonate the PayPal website with a similarly designed webpage.",
  "Transparency": "The website's contact information is N/A since it is a blog.",
  "Impersonation": "The website is trying to impersonate the real PayPal login page to trick users. The presence of a blogspot domain does not match an official PayPal webpage. The website is likely attempting to harvest user credentials.",
  "Other": "The URL (paypalloginin-usa.blogspot.com.cy) is suspicious. The misspelling of 'PayPal Login' and the use of a blogspot domain strongly suggest this is not an official PayPal website. The domain 'blogspot.com.cy' further raises a red flag, indicating a likely fraudulent website.",
