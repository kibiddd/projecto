  "Summary": "The website MILITEC.NET has a common TLD and no deceptive domain patterns. The domain was recently created and is expiring soon, with a legitimate registrar. However, the domain name could be generic or misleading, and the lack of a recent update in the WHOIS database could be a concern. The inability to load a screenshot prevents further analysis of the website's content and design, which could be indicative of a scam.",
