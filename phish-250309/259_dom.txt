  "answer1": "The domain registration is recent, as it was created on 2006-03-29 and the WHOIS database was last updated on 2025-03-10. The domain is expiring soon, on 2025-03-28, which is less than a year from the last update date. This is a potential fraud indicator as it could be a short-term registration attempt to quickly set up a malicious site before the domain expires.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@safenames.net and +44.1908200022) is not redacted or partial, but it is not suspicious on its own. However, the domain status indicates that client actions such as deletion, transfer, and update are prohibited, which could be a red flag depending on the context of the domain's use.",
  "answer3": "SafeNames Ltd. is the registrar, and there is no immediate indication that it is known for hosting malicious sites or lacks verification. However, without further information on the registrar's reputation, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment. The registrar's WHOIS server is listed as whois.safenames.net, which is a legitimate WHOIS server for SafeNames Ltd.",
  "answer4": "Other suspicious registration factors include the domain status indicating that client actions are prohibited, which could be a red flag if the domain is being used for malicious purposes. Additionally, the domain is expiring soon, which could be a tactic used by fraudsters to quickly set up a site and then disappear before the domain is taken down.",
