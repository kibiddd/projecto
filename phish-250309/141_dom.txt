  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-07 and is set to expire on 2026-03-07, which is less than a year from the current date. This is a potential fraud indicator as it suggests the domain may be used for short-term purposes, such as phishing or spam.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts is redacted for privacy. This is a common practice, but in the context of potential fraud, it can be a red flag as it prevents verification of the domain's ownership and legitimacy.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, NICENIC INTERNATIONAL GROUP CO., LIMITED, is not widely recognized as hosting malicious sites, but it is not a well-known registrar either. The lack of a well-known registrar does not necessarily indicate malicious intent, but it could be a factor in assessing the risk.",
  "answer4": "The domain status includes 'clientDeleteProhibited', 'clientTransferProhibited', and 'addPeriod', which are unusual and could indicate that the domain is being managed in a way that prevents typical domain management actions. This could be a sign of a domain being used for malicious purposes or by someone trying to obscure their activities.",
