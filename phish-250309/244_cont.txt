{
  "Phishing": "The website presents a login for Trezor Suite Web App and asks for users to manage their assets, which may involve entering personal information like credentials. This could potentially be used to steal information and access user funds, making it a phishing attempt.",
  "Suspicious offer": "N/A",
  "Format": "The website uses a professional design and layout, which is quite similar to the original Trezor website. However, the URL 'help-trezor--sso.webflow.io' is highly suspicious. The use of a subdomain (sso) could be a phishing attempt to trick users into thinking they're on a secure SSO (Single Sign-On) page. In addition, 'webflow.io' is a common web design platform and is unusual for a cryptocurrency site, suggesting the site might be a quick setup to make it seem legitimate.",
  "Transparency": "N/A",
  "Impersonation": "The website attempts to impersonate the official Trezor website by using a similar design, branding, and service offerings (crypto wallet management), to create a false sense of legitimacy and trick users into believing they are on the real site. This increases the likelihood of users entering sensitive information.",
  "Other": "The suspicious URL is the main indicator of a fraudulent site. The hyphen-separated subdomain is not part of the legitimate domain structure of Trezor. This is a common tactic to make a site appear trustworthy while being able to host the phishing component. Also, the use of 'help' in the sub-domain sounds like a support page, making users less wary. Because Webflow is commonly used to create quick websites, the URL and site design make it likely this website has been designed for malicious activity.",
