  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain contains a deceptive subdomain 'webflow.io' which is a legitimate service, but the inclusion of'support-en-coinbase-sso-cdn' might be misleading as it suggests a connection to Coinbase, which could be a tactic to deceive users into thinking it's related to Coinbase's support.",
  "TLD": "The TLD '.io' is commonly used by startups and is not inherently high-risk, but it is not as common as '.com', '.net', or '.org'.",
  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters. It appears to be a standard URL structure.",
