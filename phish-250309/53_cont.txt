  "Phishing": "The website is likely requesting personal information to sign up and potentially payment for buying BTC. This is a typical phishing scenario.",
  "Suspicious offer": "Offering $7 in ETH after sign-up could be a legitimate marketing tactic, but it also raises a flag as a 'too-good-to-be-true' offer, especially if the sign-up process is unusual or requires excessive personal details.",

  "Impersonation": "The website attempts to mimic the authentic Gemini platform with branding, indicating impersonation.",
  "Other": "The domain name, 'gemiani-logain.godaddysites.com', has a typo and uses a generic hosting service, which is highly suspicious and a common tactic used in phishing attempts.",
