  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-04 and is set to expire on 2026-03-04, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This is a potential red flag for fraud as it indicates a very recent registration.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided and seems legitimate.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Global Domain Group LLC, is not widely known for hosting malicious sites, and there is no immediate indication that it lacks verification. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains that are not intended for resale. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag, but it could be a concern depending on the context. The registrar's abuse contact information is provided, which is a positive sign.",
