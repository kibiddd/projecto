  "answer1": "The domain registration is not recent, as it was created on 2013-05-08, which is well over 6 months ago. It is also not expiring soon, as the expiration date is 2028-05-08, which is more than a year away. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts is redacted for privacy. While this is common practice, it can sometimes be a red flag if combined with other suspicious factors. However, on its own, it is not a strong indicator of fraud.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, MarkMonitor Inc., is a well-known and reputable registrar. There is no indication that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status includes clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, and clientUpdateProhibited, which are common restrictions for domains managed by third-party services like Webflow. These restrictions are not inherently suspicious and do not indicate fraud.",
