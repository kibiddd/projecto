  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain 'commerzbank.myddns.me' contains a misspelling of 'commerzbank.de' which is a legitimate domain. The use of'myddns.me' instead of a more common domain extension like '.de' or '.com' could be considered deceptive.",
  "TLD": "The TLD '.me' is commonly used for personal websites and is not inherently high-risk. However, it is not as common as '.com', '.net', or '.org', which could be a minor red flag.",
