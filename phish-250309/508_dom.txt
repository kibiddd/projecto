  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@julyname.com and +852.56109513) appears to be complete and not redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, July Name Limited, has an IANA ID of 3855, which is a legitimate registrar. There is no indication that this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common restriction for domains managed by registrars. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a red flag but could be a concern depending on the context. The domain was last updated in the WHOIS database on 2025-03-10, which is very recent. The domain name MILITEC.NET could be a generic or potentially misleading name, which might be a red flag for fraud.",
