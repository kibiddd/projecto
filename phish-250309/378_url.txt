  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain contains misspellings and character substitutions, such as 'afternoon-crooked' instead of a proper word, and 'fleek.app' instead of a standard domain name. The use of hyphens and unconventional capitalization also suggests a deceptive domain.",
  "TLD": "The TLD '.on' is uncommon and not typically associated with legitimate websites, which could be a red flag for fraud.",
