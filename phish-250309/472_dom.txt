  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2018-07-07 and the WHOIS database was last updated on 2025-03-10. This means the domain is older than 6 months but not expiring soon (less than a year). So, this factor is not indicative of fraud.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (Cloudflare, Inc.) is complete and not redacted or suspicious. So, this factor is not indicative of fraud.",
  "answer3": "Cloudflare, Inc. is a reputable registrar known for hosting many legitimate websites. There is no indication that they are known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. So, this factor is not indicative of fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status includes several prohibitions such as clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited, serverDeleteProhibited, serverTransferProhibited, and serverUpdateProhibited. These prohibitions can be a red flag, but they are not necessarily indicative of fraud. They could be due to various reasons such as the domain being managed by a third-party service or the domain owner not wanting to make changes. So, this factor is not necessarily indicative of fraud.",
