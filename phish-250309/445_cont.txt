  "Phishing": "The website does not appear to be asking for personal information or payments directly on this page.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The website does not offer any suspicious deals or free services. It is a welcome screen after the set up, which is typical for the Trezor hardware wallet.",
  "Format": "The website has a clean, professional design and appears to be well-formatted with no obvious typos in the provided screenshot.",
  "Transparency": "The website seems to be a welcome or informational page, which doesn't require contact information at this stage. However, because it is using a Webflow domain, this might be a red flag, and it's crucial to check the actual Trezor website to ensure its authenticity.",
  "Impersonation": "It could be impersonating the official Trezor welcome page, as the webflow domain could be misleading.",
  "Other": "The fact that the website is using a Webflow domain instead of the official Trezor domain is a significant red flag. It suggests that this might be a phishing attempt. The website does use the real Trezor logo. However, without further investigation, it's not possible to fully rule out the chance of it being a phishing attempt.",
