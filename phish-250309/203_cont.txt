{"Phishing": "The website, as displayed in the provided screenshot, appears to be promoting a crypto credit card and does not directly request sensitive personal information or immediate payments. However, the presence of \"Log in\" and \"Get started\" buttons could potentially lead to phishing if the user is redirected to a fake login page. Because the website is a Webflow hosted page, the website is likely not the real BlockFi page, since it's highly improbable that BlockFi would host their website under this URL.", "Suspicious offer": "The offer of up to 3.5% back in crypto on every purchase could be seen as a potentially attractive offer, but the website is not offering anything for free.", "Format": "The website has a clean and professional design. No obvious typos were found in the provided screenshot.", "Transparency": "The website does not provide information such as contact details. This lack of contact information is suspicious.", "Impersonation": "The website is likely impersonating BlockFi. The URL strongly suggests this. Since it's unlikely to be an official BlockFi page, this is highly suspicious.", "Other": "The URL is very suspicious, and the use of a Webflow domain is uncommon for a major financial service. This website is likely a fake, or in other words, the website is attempting to phish BlockFi users.", "verdict": 9}
