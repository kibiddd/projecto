  "Phishing": "The website itself, based on its appearance, doesn't explicitly ask for personal information or payment details within the displayed content. However, the phishing risk is present because it mimics a legitimate site (Ledger), so a user might be deceived into entering credentials or interacting with fraudulent elements.",
  "Suspicious offer": "There are no suspicious offers in the displayed content.",
  "Format": "The website design appears clean and professional, using the Ledger branding. There are no noticeable typos in the displayed text.",
  "Transparency": "The site doesn't provide contact information. The URL contains 'webflow.io' which might suggest a platform for rapid website creation, potentially raising a small flag, although webflow is a legitimate platform.",
  "Impersonation": "The website is impersonating the official Ledger website, as it uses the same branding and aims to provide a Ledger Live Web interface. The use of a similar domain name, especially including 'led-ger', is a common tactic used in phishing attacks.",
  "Other": "The URL, containing 'portal-led-ger----live-cdn.webflow.io', is highly suspicious. The extra hyphens in the domain name are often used in phishing attempts to subtly deceive users. This is the strongest indicator of fraud.",
