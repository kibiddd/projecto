  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2020-01-20 and the registration information was last updated on 2023-08-31. This means the domain has been registered for over 3 years, which is not recent (less than 6 months) nor expiring soon (less than a year).",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided (Registrant Organization, Registrant State/Province, Registrant Country, Registrant Email, Admin Email, Tech Email, Billing Email, Registrar Abuse Contact Email, Registrar Abuse Contact Phone) is either redacted or partial, as the actual contact details are not provided and instead, it directs to query the RDDS service of the Registrar of Record. This is a common practice but can be a red flag for potential fraud.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, CHENGDU WEST DIMENSION DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD., is not widely recognized as hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. However, without specific information on the registrar's reputation, it's difficult to definitively say whether it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. This factor alone does not strongly indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "Other suspicious registration factors include the domain being unsigned for DNSSEC, which could indicate a lack of security measures. However, this alone does not strongly indicate fraud without additional context.",
