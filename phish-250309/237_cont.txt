  "Phishing": "The website prompts the user to take steps to secure their account, which could be a phishing attempt if it leads to the user entering sensitive information on a fake site.",
  "Suspicious offer": "N/A",
  "Format": "The provided screenshot appears to be a basic interface, but it doesn't indicate poor design or typos. However, the context of the URL being a 'help center' for 'case-id' suggests a potential lack of official branding.",
  "Transparency": "The URL structure, including the use of a third-party domain (.co.uk) and a Facebook tracking parameter (?fbclid), raises transparency concerns. The lack of clear company branding or contact information adds to the suspicion.",
  "Impersonation": "The URL, especially with its long parameters, may attempt to impersonate a legitimate help center, although the context cannot be determined from the provided image.",
