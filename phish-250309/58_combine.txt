  "Summary": "The website 'gigantic-holiday.surge.sh' appears to be a scam. The domain'surge.sh' is uncommon and considered high-risk, and the subdomain 'gigantic-holiday' could be deceptive. The URL contains an excessive length and a random string, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the true destination. The domain was registered on 2014-07-25 and the expiration date is 2025-07-25, which means it is not recent and not expiring soon. The registrant, admin, and tech contact information is redacted for privacy. The registrar, 1API GmbH, is known for hosting malicious sites and lacking verification. The website is requesting an email, phone or Skype, which is personal information used for account login, indicating a phishing attempt. The website is impersonating a Microsoft sign-in page. The URL being a randomly named surge.sh domain is highly suspicious.",
