  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2006-03-29 and is expiring on 2025-03-28, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not recent nor expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@safenames.net and +44.1908200022) is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious.",
  "answer3": "SafeNames Ltd. is a legitimate registrar, and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. The registrar's WHOIS information is also valid and up-to-date.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that clientDelete, clientTransfer, and clientUpdate are prohibited, which is unusual and could be a red flag. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not a common practice for domains that are actively used and maintained. However, these factors alone do not necessarily indicate fraud.",
