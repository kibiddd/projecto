  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2016-07-11 and is expiring on 2026-07-11, which is more than 6 years from now. Therefore, it is not recent or expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The registrant, admin, and tech contact information is redacted for privacy, which is common practice but can also be a red flag if combined with other suspicious factors.",
  "answer3": "No-IP is a well-known registrar, but it is also known for hosting dynamic DNS services, which can sometimes be used by malicious actors. However, No-IP itself is not typically associated with hosting malicious sites.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a legitimate restriction, but it might also be a sign of a domain that is being closely monitored or controlled.",
