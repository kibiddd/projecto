{"Phishing": "The website is advertising a credit card, which could involve requests for personal information and potentially payment details during the application process. This is a potential phishing risk.", "Suspicious offer": "Offering up to 3.5% back in crypto could be seen as a generous, but not necessarily suspicious, offer, especially if it's an introductory rate.", "Format": "The website design appears professional and of high quality, with no obvious typos. The images are also well done.", "Transparency": "Based on the screenshot, the website is selling a financial product. The website appears to have a clear brand and a clear value proposition. But it's hard to assess its transparency based on the image.", "Impersonation": "N/A", "Other": "The URL `http://secure-blockfi-sso--cdn--b.webflow.io` raises some concern. The use of 'cdn' (Content Delivery Network) is normal but the inclusion of '--b' and the appearance of a less-than-standard domain can be a red flag.", "verdict": 4}
