  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain 'haacken.com' contains a misspelling of 'hackers.com', which is a common tactic used by fraudulent sites to deceive users.",

  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters that are typically associated with fraudulent URLs.",
  "Other": "The URL contains a mix of alphanumeric characters and hyphens, which is typical for many legitimate websites. However, the presence of 'backup/sngzamfl/ic-access/otp.html' in the path could be suspicious, as it does not clearly indicate the nature of the website or its content.",
