  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2024-09-29 and the registration is expiring on 2025-09-29, which is less than a year from today (2025-03-07). This is a potential fraud indicator as it suggests the domain may be set up for short-term use, possibly for phishing or other malicious activities.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided (Abuse Contact Email: ZYS@GNAME.COM and Phone: +65.65189986) appears to be valid and not redacted or suspicious. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Gname 216 Inc, is known for hosting malicious sites and lacks verification. This is a significant fraud indicator as it suggests the domain may be registered through a registrar with a poor reputation for security and legitimacy.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a red flag if the domain is being used for fraudulent purposes, as it may be harder to move the domain to a more reputable registrar. Additionally, the DNSSEC is unsigned, which is a security concern. These factors contribute to the potential fraud score.",
