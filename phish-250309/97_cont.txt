  "Phishing": "The website doesn't directly ask for personal information or payment in this specific error message, but the context (likely related to a gambling or gaming site) increases the risk of later requests for such data.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The website itself is not making any offer, but the nature of the service (likely online gambling) is often associated with tempting offers that could be scams.",
  "Format": "The website displays a generic 'Forbidden' error message, indicating a problem with access. This is not a sign of fraud in itself, but the masking of the IP address adds to the suspicious nature.",
  "Transparency": "The message mentions contacting customer service, but it's unclear what type of service or company is providing the website. This lack of clear identification raises concerns.",
  "Impersonation": "The website is inaccessible, making it impossible to assess any impersonation attempts. However, the nature of online gambling, the use of a potentially temporary IP address, and the lack of transparency create a general lack of trust.",
  "Other": "The website is not accessible, and the error message blocks further analysis. However, based on the content, the website might be connected to gambling services. It is also important to note that the IP address is masked.",
