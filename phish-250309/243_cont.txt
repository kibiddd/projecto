  "Phishing": "The website is promoting Trezor Suite app and does not appear to be directly asking for sensitive personal information or payment information, as a first impression.",

  "Transparency": "The website does not show contact information, but at first glance, it may be a landing page that links to legitimate Trezor services.",
  "Impersonation": "The website's design and branding aligns with the legitimate Trezor brand, however, the URL seems fishy, and that is a huge red flag.",
  "Other": "The URL (help-suite-io-trezrr.webflow.io) is highly suspicious. It includes 'help', but the spelling of Trezor is incorrect ('trezrr') and is hosted on Webflow, suggesting it's not the official Trezor website.",
