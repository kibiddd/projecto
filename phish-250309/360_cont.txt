  "Phishing": "The website is designed to facilitate cryptocurrency trading, which inherently involves financial transactions and potentially sensitive information. This could be a vector for phishing attempts to steal credentials or financial data.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The site doesn't explicitly make suspicious offers. It's a platform for buying and selling crypto. However, the general nature of crypto trading can be volatile and involves risk.",
  "Format": "The website has a clean and professional design with high-quality images. There are no obvious typos. This suggests a degree of legitimacy.",
  "Transparency": "The presence of 'Log In' and 'Sign Up' buttons and mention of popular cryptocurrencies suggests that the site is for cryptocurrency trading, although it is difficult to confirm full transparency without accessing the website itself.",
  "Impersonation": "The website uses the 'NDAX' branding, which could potentially be impersonating an established cryptocurrency exchange. However, there's no definitive proof of this from just the screenshot.",
  "Other": "The use of 'secure-sso' in the URL could be a red flag as it is related to single sign-on, and although it is not a definitive factor, it could make the site more susceptible to phishing campaigns. However, it is not clear if the URL is legitimate.",
