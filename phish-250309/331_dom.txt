  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-06 and is expiring on 2026-03-06, which is less than a year. This is a potential red flag for fraud as it indicates a short-term registration.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided is a URL to the registrar's WHOIS admin contact page, which is not a direct contact detail. This could be considered suspicious as it does not provide a direct way to contact the domain owner.",
