  "Deceptive Domain": "The domain 'globalauthresolution.pages.dev' does not contain obvious misspellings or character substitutions. However, the use of 'pages.dev' as a subdomain could be considered deceptive as it is a known platform for hosting websites, which might be used to mask the true nature of the site.",
  "TLD": "The TLD '.dev' is commonly used for development and testing purposes and is not typically considered high-risk. It is not uncommon and does not inherently indicate fraud.",
  "Patterns": "The URL does not contain excessive length, random strings, or unusual characters. It appears to be a standard URL structure.",
