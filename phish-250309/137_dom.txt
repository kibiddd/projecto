  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-01-19 and the registry expiry date is 2026-01-19. This means the domain is less than 6 months old and will expire in less than a year. Both of these factors can be indicators of potential fraud, as they are common characteristics of newly created domains used for malicious purposes.",
  "answer2": "The registrant, admin, and tech contact information is redacted for privacy. This lack of transparency can be a red flag, as it makes it difficult to verify the legitimacy of the domain owner and their intentions.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Gname.com Pte. Ltd., is known for hosting a large number of domains, some of which have been associated with malicious activities. While not all domains hosted by Gname.com are malicious, the association with a registrar that has a history of hosting potentially harmful sites can be a concern.",
