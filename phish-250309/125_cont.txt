Weebly is a free website builder, making it easy to create a quick, low-cost site for malicious purposes. The use of a generic URL structure like this is highly indicative of phishing. Additionally, the specific dates in the domain name suggest an attempt to create a sense of urgency or a limited-time offer, a technique often used in phishing.",
