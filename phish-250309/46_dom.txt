  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-06 and is expiring on 2026-03-06, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This is a potential fraud indicator as domains registered very recently and expiring soon can be used for short-term malicious activities.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts is redacted and requires querying the RDDS service of the Registrar of Record. This is a potential fraud indicator as it is common for fraudulent domains to obscure contact details to avoid detection and accountability.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, HOSTINGER, is known for hosting a large number of domains, some of which may be malicious. However, without specific evidence of malicious activity, it is not possible to definitively state that this registrar hosts malicious sites. Still, it is a potential fraud indicator due to the association with a large number of domains.",
  "answer4": "The domain status includes several prohibitions such as serverTransferProhibited, clientHold, and clientDeleteProhibited. These prohibitions can be a red flag, as they may indicate that the domain is under investigation or has been flagged for suspicious activity. Additionally, the domain is unsigned for DNSSEC, which is another potential fraud indicator.",
