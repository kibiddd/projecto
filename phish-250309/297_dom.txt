  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2019-03-08 and the registration is not recent (more than 6 months old). The expiry date is 2026-03-08, which is more than a year away. Therefore, the domain is not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (abuse@support.gandi.net and +33.170377661) is not redacted or partial. It appears to be legitimate and not suspicious.",
  "answer3": "Gandi SAS is a well-known registrar and is not typically associated with hosting malicious sites. However, the domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which could be a red flag depending on the context. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily indicative of malicious intent but could be a security concern.",
  "answer4": "The domain name 'SERVICE-OFFICE365.COM' is somewhat generic and could potentially be used for phishing or other fraudulent activities. The use of 'CLOUDFLARE' in the name servers is common and not inherently suspicious, but the combination with the generic domain name could be a concern.",
