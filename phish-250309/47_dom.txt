  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2024-07-07 and has an expiration date of 2025-07-07, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This makes it a recent registration and indicates that it is expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The registrant, admin, and tech contact information is redacted for privacy. This is a common practice, but in the context of potential fraud, it can be a red flag as it prevents verification of the domain's ownership and legitimacy.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Sav.com, LLC, is not widely recognized as a reputable registrar. The WHOIS server provided is 'whois-service.virtualcloud.co', which does not appear to be a standard or well-known registrar. This could be a sign of a less reputable or potentially malicious registrar.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This could be a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfers, but it could also be a tactic used by fraudulent domains to avoid detection and removal.",
