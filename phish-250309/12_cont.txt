  "Phishing": "The website promotes trading cryptocurrencies and does not request personal information directly in the provided screenshot. However, the actual platform might require account creation and potentially financial data later.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The site's primary offer (trading cryptocurrencies) isn't inherently suspicious, but it's crucial to remember that crypto investments carry high risk. It's not offering anything excessively 'too good to be true.'",
  "Format": "The website's design looks professional, with no obvious typos or design flaws.",
  "Transparency": "The contact information is unclear from the provided screen shot. It is not possible to assess its transparency.",
  "Impersonation": "The site is promoting crypto.com, so it could potentially impersonate them if it were to provide fake data or have different contact information.",
  "Other": "The 'webflow.io' domain hints that the website is a demo or a simple landing page built on a website builder, which is not suspicious in itself. However, a real crypto exchange platform should use a more robust and secure infrastructure.",
