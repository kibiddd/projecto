  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-07 and is set to expire on 2026-03-07, which is less than a year from the current date. This is a potential fraud indicator as it suggests the domain may be used for short-term purposes, such as phishing or scam activities.",
  "answer2": "The contact information for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts is redacted for privacy. This is a common practice, but in the context of potential fraud, it can be a red flag as it prevents verification of the domain's ownership and legitimacy.",
  "answer3": "Dynadot is a well-known registrar, but the domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited' and 'addPeriod', which are not inherently indicative of malicious activity. However, without further information on the registrar's reputation for hosting malicious sites, it's difficult to determine if this is a fraud indicator.",
  "answer4": "Other suspicious registration factors include the domain name'super-powered-marke.click', which is a common pattern used in phishing attacks. Additionally, the domain status 'unsigned' for DNSSEC suggests that the domain's DNS security is not verified, which could be a concern for security.",
