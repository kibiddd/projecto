  "Summary": "The website 'prosystemsug.com' appears to be a misspelled version of a legitimate domain 'prosys.com'. The domain was registered in 2013 and is not expiring soon. The registrar, NameCheap, Inc., is reputable. However, the website requests personal information and attempts to impersonate Idaho Central Credit Union's login page, which are common phishing tactics. The URL is suspicious and the website may be trying to deceive users.",
