  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-04 and is set to expire on 2026-03-04, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is relatively new and may be expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, which is a positive sign.",
  "answer3": "The registrar, Global Domain Group LLC, is not widely known for hosting malicious sites, and there is no immediate indication that it lacks verification. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains that are not intended for resale. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator, but it could be a security concern. The registrar's abuse contact information is provided, which is a positive sign.",
