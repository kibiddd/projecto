  "answer1": "The domain was created on 2024-03-09 and the registration is less than 6 months old. The domain is also set to expire in 2026, which is more than a year away. Therefore, it is not expiring soon.",
  "answer2": "The contact information provided by the registrar (Abuse Contact Email: complaint@gname.com and Phone: +65.65189986) is not redacted or partial. It appears to be legitimate and not suspicious.",
  "answer3": "Gname.com Pte. Ltd. is a well-known registrar, and there is no indication that it hosts malicious sites or lacks verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates 'clientTransferProhibited', which means the domain cannot be transferred to another registrar. This is a common restriction and does not indicate fraud. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator, as many domains do not use DNSSEC. The last update of the whois database was on 2025-03-10, which is very recent. However, this alone does not indicate fraud.",
