{"Phishing": "The website requests personal information (full name, street address) to verify the shipping address, which is a potential phishing attempt as it could be used to collect sensitive data. The request for re-delivery suggests an attempt to gain access to the package.", "Suspicious offer": "The website offers re-delivery, which could be suspicious if it's not part of the normal USPS process.", "Format": "The website presents a legitimate USPS tracking interface. However, there's an error message at the top. It's unclear if the format itself is low quality, as the image quality and design are fine, but the user flow may be designed to be more complex, and the top banner raises concerns.", "Transparency": "The website does not explicitly provide contact information.", "Impersonation": "The website is trying to mimic the USPS website to appear legitimate and deceive users into providing their information.", "Other": "The fact that the website is hosted on a 'vercel.app' domain is somewhat unusual for an official USPS website. The presence of an error message about generating a desktop version on a mobile device adds to the suspicion, as does the need to re-enter address information for tracking. The domain also seems to be attempting to impersonate itself by repeating the root domain.", "verdict": 8}
