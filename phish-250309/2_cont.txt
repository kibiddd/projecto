  "Phishing": "The website itself does not appear to be directly requesting personal information or payment based on the provided image of the 'forbidden' page. However, it is impossible to assess the phishing potential without knowing the website's function.",
  "Suspicious offer": "The error message does not involve any offers, so it's N/A.",
  "Format": "The image shows a simple 'forbidden' page with a clear error message. There appears to be a minor layout problem in which the beginning and end of one line are cut, but this does not necessarily indicate a fraudulent website.",
  "Transparency": "The image mentions customer service contact, which could be an attempt at transparency. However, it's impossible to verify the legitimacy of the contact information without further investigation. ",
  "Impersonation": "It's difficult to assess impersonation without knowing what the website is pretending to be. The error message does not suggest any attempt at impersonation.",
  "Other": "The fact that the website is showing a 'forbidden' error could indicate that it is not a legitimate website. The image is likely from a gambling or gaming website.",
