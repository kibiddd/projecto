  "Phishing": "The website could potentially be a phishing attempt if it leads to a login page or requests wallet access, as this is a common tactic for stealing crypto. However, without further interactions with the website, this is not fully determined.",
  "Suspicious offer": "N/A",
  "Format": "The website has a clean design but the URL 'auth-s-started-traizor.webflow.io' raises suspicion because 'traizor' is a misspelling of 'Trezor.' Webflow websites themselves aren't inherently suspicious, but the misspelling suggests an attempt to mimic a legitimate website.",
  "Transparency": "N/A",
  "Impersonation": "The website is attempting to impersonate Trezor, the legitimate hardware wallet provider, due to the misspelling and the design matching a typical Trezor interface. The use of a Webflow domain can be a red flag because malicious actors can set up their website quickly using services like Webflow.",
  "Other": "The URL's use of 'auth-s' and association with 'started' suggests that the website is attempting to hijack an authorization flow.",
