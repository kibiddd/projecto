It's blocked and the provided contact information is unclear, increasing the risk.", "Impersonation": "The website is presenting itself in a way that's not clear, given that it's blocked. It could be impersonating a legitimate gambling or gaming service.", "Other": "The 'Forbidden' error and the obscured information raise security concerns.
