The domain is not expiring soon either, as the expiration date is 2027-04-22. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",

  "answer3": "The registrar, No-IP, is a well-known and reputable registrar that hosts many legitimate domains. There is no indication that No-IP is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers are prohibited. This is a common restriction for domains managed by No-IP and does not necessarily indicate fraud. Additionally, the domain uses No-IP's name servers, which are legitimate. Therefore, this factor does not indicate potential fraud.",
