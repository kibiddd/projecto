  "answer1": "The domain was registered on 2025-03-05 and is set to expire on 2026-03-05, which is less than a year from the current date of 2025-03-07. This indicates that the domain is relatively new and may be expiring soon, which can be a potential fraud indicator.",
  "answer2": "The WHOIS information provided is complete and does not appear to be redacted or suspicious. The contact information for the registrar is also provided, which is a positive sign.",
  "answer3": "Tucows Domains Inc. is a reputable registrar known for hosting legitimate domains. There is no indication that this registrar is known for hosting malicious sites or lacking verification.",
  "answer4": "The domain status indicates that client transfers and updates are prohibited, which is a common practice for domains that are not intended for resale or transfer. The DNSSEC is unsigned, which is not necessarily a fraud indicator but could be a security concern. The domain name 'COMMERZ-BRIEFUPDATE.COM' does not immediately suggest any fraudulent activity, but the recent registration and impending expiration could be a red flag.",
